### Calculation Methods

#### Allometric Scaling
```
Scaled Factor = (Target Weight / Base Weight) ^ Scaling Exponent
where Scaling Exponent is customizable (default: 0.75)
```

#### Brain Weight Scaling
```
Scaling Factor = (2/3) * ln(Target Brain / Source Brain) / ln(Target Weight / Source Weight)
```

#### Life-Span Scaling
```
Scaling Factor = ln(Target Life / Source Life) / ln(Target Weight / Source Weight)
```

#### Hepatic Flow Scaling
```
Clearance Ratio = Hepatic Clearance / Hepatic Flow
Scaling Factor = ln((Target Flow * Target Ratio) / (Source Flow * Source Ratio)) / ln(Target Weight / Source Weight)
```

#### Body Surface Area Scaling
```
Scaling Factor = (Target BSA / Source BSA) ^ 0.67
```

## Important Notes

1. Brain weight values are based on adult animals and may vary by strain/breed
2. Hepatic blood flow values are from Davies & Morris (1993) and recent literature
3. Clearance values are population averages and may vary by compound
4. Life span data represents typical maximum values in controlled conditions
5. For more accurate dosing, consider drug-specific parameters such as:
   - Plasma protein binding
